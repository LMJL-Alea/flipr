The goal of the [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) package is to
provide a flexible framework for making inference via permutation. The idea is
to promote the permutation framework as an incredibly well-suited tool for
inference on complex data. You supply your data, as complex as it might be, in
the form of lists in which each entry stores one data point in a representation
that suits you and [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) takes care of
the permutation magic and provides you with either point estimates or confidence
regions or $p$-value of hypothesis tests. Permutation tests are especially
appealing because they are exact no matter how small or big your sample sizes
are. You can also use the so-called *non-parametric combination* approach in
this setting to combine several statistics to better target the alternative
hypothesis you are testing against. Asymptotic consistency is also guaranteed
under mild conditions on the statistic you use. The
[**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) package provides a flexible
permutation framework for making inference such as point estimation, confidence
intervals or hypothesis testing, on any kind of data, be it univariate,
multivariate, or more complex such as network-valued data, topological data,
functional data or density-valued data.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of
[**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) on CRAN with:
``` r
install.packages("flipr")
```

Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/flipr")
```
## Example

```{r}
library(flipr)
```

We hereby use the very simple t-test for comparing the means of two univariate
samples to show how easy it is to carry out a permutation test with
[**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/).

### Data generation

Let us first generate two samples of size $15$ governed by Gaussian distributions with equal variance but different means:
```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 15
x <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(n = n, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```

Given the data we simulated, the parameter of interest here is the difference between the means of the distributions, say $\delta = \mu_y - \mu_x$.

### Make the two samples exchangeable under $H_0$

In the context of null hypothesis testing, we consider the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_y - \mu_x = \delta$. We can use a permutation scheme to approach the $p$-value if the two samples are *exchangeable* under $H_0$. This means that we need to transform for example the second sample to *make* it  exchangeable with the first sample under $H_0$. In this simple example, this can be achieved as follows. Let $X_1, \dots, X_{n_x} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x, 1)$ and $Y_1, \dots, Y_{n_y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y, 1)$. We can then transform the second sample as $Y_i \longleftarrow Y_i - \delta$.

We can define a proper function to do this, termed the *null specification* function, which takes two input arguments:

- `y` which is a list storing the data points in the second sample;
- `parameters` which is a numeric vector of values for the parameters under investigation (here only $\delta$ and thus `parameters` is of length $1$ with `parameters[1] = delta`).

In our simple example, it boils down to:
```{r}
null_spec <- function(y, parameters) {
  purrr::map(y, ~ .x - parameters[1])
}
```

### Choose suitable test statistics

Next, we need to decide which test statistic(s) we are going to use for performing the test. Here, we are only interested in one parameter, namely the mean difference $\delta$. Since the two samples share the same variance, we can use for example the $t$-statistic with a pooled estimate of the common variance.

This statistic can be easily computed using `stats::t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$statistic`. However, we want to extend its evaluation to any permuted version of the data. Test statistic functions compatible with [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) should have at least two mandatory input arguments:

- `data` which is either a concatenated list of size $n_x + n_y$ regrouping the data points of both samples or a distance matrix of size $(n_x + n_y) \times (n_x + n_y)$ stored as an object of class `dist`.
- `indices1` which is an integer vector of size $n_x$ storing the indices of the data points belonging to the first sample in the current permuted version of the data.

Some test statistics are already implemented in [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) and ready to use. User-defined test statistics can be used as well, with the use of the helper function `use_stat(nsamples = 2, stat_name = )`. This function creates and saves an `.R` file in the `R/` folder of the current working directory and populates it with the following template:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' Test Statistic for the Two-Sample Problem
#'
#' This function computes the test statistic...
#'
#' @param data A list storing the concatenation of the two samples from which
#'   the user wants to make inference. Alternatively, a distance matrix stored
#'   in an object of class \code{\link[stats]{dist}} of pairwise distances
#'   between data points.
#' @param indices1 An integer vector that contains the indices of the data
#'   points belong to the first sample in the current permuted version of the
#'   data.
#'
#' @return A numeric value evaluating the desired test statistic.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # TO BE DONE BY THE DEVELOPER OF THE PACKAGE
stat_{{{name}}} <- function(data, indices1) {
  n <- if (inherits(data, "dist"))
    attr(data, "Size")
  else if (inherits(data, "list"))
    length(data)
  else
    stop("The `data` input should be of class either list or dist.")

  indices2 <- seq_len(n)[-indices1]

  x <- data[indices1]
  y <- data[indices2]

  # Here comes the code that computes the desired test
  # statistic from input samples stored in lists x and y

}
```

For instance, a [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/)-compatible version of the $t$-statistic with pooled variance will look like:
```{r}
my_t_stat <- function(data, indices1) {
  n <- if (inherits(data, "dist"))
    attr(data, "Size")
  else if (inherits(data, "list"))
    length(data)
  else
    stop("The `data` input should be of class either list or dist.")

  indices2 <- seq_len(n)[-indices1]

  x <- data[indices1]
  y <- data[indices2]
  
  # Here comes the code that computes the desired test
  # statistic from input samples stored in lists x and y
  x <- unlist(x)
  y <- unlist(y)
  
  stats::t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$statistic
}
```

Here, we are only going to use the $t$-statistic for this example, but we might be willing to use more than one statistic for a parameter or we might have several parameters under investigation, each one of them requiring a different test statistic. We therefore group all the test statistics that we need into a single list:
```{r}
stat_functions <- list(my_t_stat)
```

### Assign test statistics to parameters

Finally we need to define a named list that tells [**flipr**](https://astamm.github.io/flipr/) which test statistics among the ones declared in the `stat_functions` list should be used for each parameter under investigation. This is used to determine bounds on each parameter for the plausibility function. This list, often termed `stat_assignments`, should therefore have as many elements as there are parameters under investigation. Each element should be named after a parameter under investigation and should list the indices corresponding to the test statistics that should be used for that parameter in `stat_functions`. In our example, it boils down to:
```{r}
stat_assignments <- list(delta = 1)
```

### Use the plausibility function

Now we can instantiate a plausibility function as follows:
```{r}
pf <- PlausibilityFunction$new(
  null_spec = null_spec,
  stat_functions = stat_functions,
  stat_assignments = stat_assignments,
  x, y
)
```

Now, assume we want to test the following hypotheses:

$$ H_0: \delta = 0 \quad \mbox{v.s.} \quad H_1: \delta \ne 0. $$

We use the `$get_value()` method for this purpose, which essentially evaluates the permutation $p$-value of a two-sided test by default:
```{r}
pf$get_value(0)
```

We can compare the resulting $p$-value with the one obtained using the more classic parametric test:
```{r}
t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value
```

The permutation $p$-value does not quite match the parametric one. This is because of two reasons:

1. The resolution of a permutation $p$-value is of the order of $1/(B+1)$, where $B$ is the number of sampled permutations. By default, the plausibility function is instantiated with $B = 1000$:
```{r}
pf$nperms
```
2. We randomly sample $B$ permutations out of the $\binom{n_x+n_y}{n_x}$ possible permutations and therefore introduce extra variability in the $p$-value.

If we were to ask for more permutations, say $B = 1,000,000$, we would be much closer to the parametric $p$-value:
```{r}
pf$set_nperms(1000000)
pf$get_value(0)
```
